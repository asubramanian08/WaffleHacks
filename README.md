# Waffle Hacks

## About
We competed in the 2022 Waffle hacks hackathon from June 17th to June 19th 2022 against over 75 other teams! It was an amazing experience and we are all proud of the final product!

## Nibble
Our project's name is nibble, aimed toward food insecurity. The goal of our project is to help people with food allergies and help them find places they can eat at. Our system works by using the google maps API to find places that are close to the user. We then sort the near by places based on restaurant's dietary restrict rating. People will rate restaurants out of fives starts for how well they work for a certain diary restriction. The given ratings are then averaged for the overall restaurants rating for that restriction.
